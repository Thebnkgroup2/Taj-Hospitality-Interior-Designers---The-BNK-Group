# Taj-Hospitality-Interior-Designers---The-BNK-Group
The new Taj was designed as a city hotel which had a blend of modernism classical and Indo-Saracenic features. The concept of being the jewel of the Taj group of hotels we chose Ruby, Emerald and Sapphire as our key to design inspiration. These jewels translated into colour themes for different areas with coordinating colours through soft furnishings. The intrinsic ingenuity of detailing right from creating new motifs and making new Jalis, screens, floor patterns was a key feature of the design.  Customized cladding details to new concepts of room layout had to be addressed as the rooms were far smaller than standard Taj room size specifications. The challenge was to retrofit a luxury hotel brand design into an existing hotel structure that was designed for a 4 star category hotel. Right from rooms to suites and public areas, every zone and corner was detailed to the minutest perfection. In the history of IHCL (Indian Hotels Company Limited), it was the first time a young Indian design agency was given this task and the design reflected the creative energy that team BNK possesses.
